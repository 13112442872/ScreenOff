# ScreenOff
An android app controling the screen to display or not display via Shizuku.
You can still touch the screen and playing your games (if you could play it without sight) after setting displayMode to Off. 
# How it works
by reflecting "android.view.SurfaceControl". See the detailed code in Scrcpy or my "SurfaceControl.java".
