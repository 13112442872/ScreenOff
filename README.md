# ScreenOff
An android app to control your Android's screen to display or not display via Shizuku.
You can still touch the screen and playing your games (if you could play it without sight) after setting displayMode to Off. 
# How it works
By reflecting "android.view.SurfaceControl" (the same way with Scrcpy). Check it in "SurfaceControl.java".
